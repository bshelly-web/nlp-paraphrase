# nlp-paraphrase
Natural language processing (NLP) is the development of applications and services that can understand human natural language. One of the flourishing implementation of the NLP is paraphrasing. 

Paraphrasing is a technique through which one can avoid the accusation of plagiarism. 

Paraphrasing is a simple way to reformulate the meaning of a certain text, using different words. Through it, it is possible to explain what a complicated text means using simple language, in order to make it easier to understand. 

In most research texts, the use of technical vocabulary is very common, because their function is to provide data and information collaboratively on the basis of experiments or research; in order to explain the doubts raised by this paraphrase, it is necessary (by using a Different languages) imitate what the text expresses. 

There are variety of models provided by huggingface that have the ability to paraphrase to rephrase a text with the combination of machine learning and natural language processing.  

On the basis of temperature, k-top and other useful parameters, you can try different modes of paraphrasing from <a href="http://aiarticlespinner.co/">article spinner</a> or rephraser: 
<ul>
<li>HUMAN</li> 

<li>AI ROBOT</li>  

<li>REMOVE PLAGIARISM</li> 

<li>FIX GRAMMAR</li> 

<li>FIX SENTENCE STRUCTURE</li>
 </ul>

GPT-3 is the neural network that has a lot of parameters with very large dataset. It has 175 billion parameters and responds very efficiently to different types of input. 

You can accomplish rephrasing tasks using any language model like 

BART 

T5 

Pegasus 

You need to fine-tune the model, but you must fine-tune the pre-trained models on large data sets. Using <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/flaubert.html">GPT-3</a>, you don't need to fine-tune any model to perform this task, and it is fast and simple. 

Here is an example of paraphrasing example: 

Article: “Searching a specific search tree for a binary key can be programmed recursively or iteratively.” 

Paraphrase: “Searching a specific search tree according to a binary key can be recursively or iteratively programmed.”
